# SARS2_interactome

a network analysis on proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPI) between viral and host proteins to better identify host biological responses, induced by both whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and specific viral proteins. A host-virus interactome was inferred, applying an explorative algorithm (Random Walk with Restart, RWR) triggered by 28 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis of PPI allowed to estimate the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the host cell. Interactome built around one single viral protein allowed to define a different response, underlining as ORF8 and ORF3a modulated cardiovascular diseases and pro-inflammatory pathways, respectively. Finally, the network-based approach highlighted a possible direct action of ORF3a and NS7b to enhancing Bradykinin Storm. All results were reported in the paper Messina et al. 2021 (DOI: ).

many functions developed, using functions of Alberto Valdeolivas and colleagues (DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty637) and reported in this file: https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/RWR-MH/blob/master/Scripts_and_Files/Network_Generation/Network_Generation_Utils.R


Here you can find two script with funtiction for interactome building and Gene Enrichment analysis.
